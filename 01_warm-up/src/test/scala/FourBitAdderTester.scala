/** 
  4-bit adder tester
  *
  * Truth tables are not very efficient for testing more complex components, 
  * as they grow exponentially with the number of input bits. Therefore, we 
  * have to think of a more clever way to test the 4-bit adder. To test the 
  * Basic Adder design in our Chisel Introduction, we used loops to generate 
  * a sequence of increasing input values testing the design. To generate 
  * test cases for the 4-bit adder, you should also start by using two nested 
  * loops. To determine the borders of the loop counter, think about the lowest 
  * and the highest unsignes integer that you can represent with four bit. To 
  * test the result produced by your design, think about what happens to the 
  * result in case of an overflow and at which point this can happen. 
  * Hint: It might be helpful to check the expected output behaviour for two 
  * different scenarios with the help of a condition.
